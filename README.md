# Destination Picker
[This website](https://francesvugts.github.io/DestinationPicker/) was created for everyone that is thinking about there next big holiday.
With help of a quiz you can select the criteria for your trip and then the Destination Picker will return the country that suits your wishes best.
## UX
### User stories
As a potential holiday booker, I want to know what criteria to think about, to be able to find a suitable holiday destination.
I want to be able to submit my wishes on the different criteria and then I want to be provided with the destination that would best suit my wishes, so that I can make a well-advised decision.
When the answer is provided, I want to know why the presented destination suits my wishes, so that I will be sure it is a good fit and to get enthusiastic to book a holiday to this destination.
As a website user, I want to be able to contact the owner of the website, so that I can ask any questions I have regarding the website.
### Design
You can find the wireframes that I used for this project [here](https://ibb.co/jLYNtsg).

It provides insight in how I wanted my question and result pages to look on a desktop, mobile and tablet.
The most important thing for me was to have a clean and simple look.
It had to be a fun, quick and easy quiz!
## Features
In this project I added the following features:
* The user navigates through the website by clicking on the buttons for very easy use
* I've added in icons from font awesome and buttons from Bootstrap to get a nice clean look
* I've used the grid system from Bootstrap in all my html pages to make them responsive on different devices
* I've added in an envelope icon to open a modal with a form to contact the owner of the website
* I've added mandatory fields to the contact form
* I've added in emailJS
* My function to send a mail to the owner of the website includes code to empty the contact form after sending a message
* My function to send a mail to the owner of the website includes a pop-up to let the user know a mail has been send succesfully
* I've added in jQuery to continue to the next question when an answer gets clicked
* I've added in a variable for each country because I still have to learn how to use a database
* I've added in a function that increases the score for all countries that match the selected answer from the user
* I've added in a function that returns the page of the country with the highest score at the end of the quiz
## Features left to Implement
When spending more time on this project, I would like to include the following features:
* More countries that can be shown as a result
* A database to store those countries
